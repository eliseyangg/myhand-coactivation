# myhand-coactivation

[MyHand]([url](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/research-projects/hand-orthosis-stroke-rehabilitation)) is a project developed by a cross-disciplinary team in mechanical engineering and computer science at Columbia University's [ROAM Lab]([url](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/)). This project is a robotic hand orthosis that aids stroke patients in hand movement rehabilitation by inferring intent using reinforcement learning through electromyography (EMG) signals. 

As part of this team, I designed and implemented a method to generate profiles of subject-specific EMG activations for different hand intents. The profile is called a coactivation map, which details at a certain hand intent, what EMG channels are activated on the armband, and how much they are activated relative to the others. The visualization is a 3x8 matrix, in which the rows represent intent [relaxed, open, closed], and the columns represent EMG channel [emg0, emg1, â€¦, emg7] that can be plotted onto a heatmap.

My project has involved building this codebase with various helper functions that include preprocessing/data manipulation functions and data visualization functions that make handling data very easy and manageable. The raw data input is time-series EMG amplitudes, collected at 50 or 200 Hz, and labeled with ground truth values of open, closed, or relaxed intents. After exploring various preprocessing steps, I found the simple max normalization to be the most effective in determining relative coactivations such that we can compare values easily with other data files that may exhibit amplitudes of a different scale. To create the coactivation map, I grouped the data by intent (ground truth labels), and EMG channels to get the 3x8 matrix, and calculated the medians by those groupings (it is also possible to calculate variation and mean from those groupings to create a mapping of a different metric). From these maps, I have also added functions to my codebase that can compare mappings of coactivations together, take the average of multiple coactivation maps (i.e. if we want to combine all healthy, if we want to combine all for one subject across all sessions).

From all previous EMG data collected from MyHand and using my codebase, I created a dataset of coactivation maps (24 dimensions). Using this data, I performed k-means clustering and KNN, where I (1) confirmed our existing knowledge that there are no significantly and distinctly different clusters within the healthy subjects (found there are two main recognizable clusters with very slight differences), (2) confirmed stroke subjects exhibit arbitrary patterns dissimilar to healthy subjects, and (3) found there is not a significant difference between the mirrored, healthy, left-hand coactivations and the healthy right-hand coactivations. From deductions (1) and (3), I have created a generalized coactivation profile for healthy patients, consisting of all healthy patient data. In the future, I would be eager to see these tools I have developed to help engineer features that will allow us to discover whether the stroke patient EMG signal patterns of the hand are truly arbitrary, and extract real-time patient profiles and their deviations from the healthy profile to condition and thus refine the intent-learning framework.
